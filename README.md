My favorite applications: 
    1. Pintrest
          i. You can click on an image and find very similar pictures to it
         ii. The dark theme
        iii. The icons are the right size on the mobile, everything looks right in place
        
    2. Webtoon
          i. Very smooth overall
         ii. Every section is readible, nothing is cluttered or looks out of place
        iii. Keeps track of where you left off 
        
    3. WhatsApp
          i. Deleting/editing message
         ii. Having the option to time photos/videos (can only be viewed once or more)
        iii. change the text background
        
    4. Discord
          i. Having private channels
         ii. Sending large files
        iii. Pinning messages

    5. Netflix
          i. The dark-theme 
         ii. Has a my-list 
        iii. The "more like this" option to find similar entertainment is very helpful 


An app I'd like to build:
I would improve my school's blackboard app. It is really inconvenient as of right now. First off,
I'd make it look more fit to be a moible app, rather than a website on a desktop. It is very
clustered. Some features I would add are: viewing your schedule, grades, assingments due, more
easily. As well as, being able to contact your professors. I would change the layout of the app
too. The fonts, and colors are not as pleasing to look at, a dark theme and a light theme option
would be very nice!
